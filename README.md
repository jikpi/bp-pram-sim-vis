# PRAM simulator

This application is a capable PRAM abstract machine simulator, supporting the variants EREW, CREW, CRCW (Priority, Arbitrary, Common). Code is executed synchronously. This model starts as a RAM machine that can launch parallel machines, thus optionally allowing for elegant management of resources and parallel machines, simplifying the code of parallel machines. The RAM launched at the beginning is referred to as "master RAM".

A user manual is available inside the application.
